1. Getting Started
Open Xcode and create a new SwiftUI project named ARLabUI.
Copy the files from this patch into your new project’s main group.

2. Understanding the Structure
ContentView.swift: Main UI and AR mode toggle.
MockARView.swift: Simulator-only AR scene placeholder with object placement.
ARManager.swift/VirtualObject.swift: Core logic and data model.
ARUIOverlay.swift: Floating AR controls.
Persistence.swift: Simple persistence.

3. Running in Simulator
Run project in the iOS simulator.
Use "Add Object" to add a new virtual cube.
Use "Reset" to clear.
Tap anywhere in the AR placeholder to 'place' (simulate placement of) the first object.
The overlay tracks object count and options.

4. Real Device Extension (Lab Part 2)
Replace the placeholder text in ContentView.swift’s else branch with a UIViewRepresentable that embeds an ARSCNView or ARView for true ARKit-based object placement.
Invite students to move from the simulator to an iPhone/iPad for real AR interaction (optional challenge).

5. Submission & Reflection
Ask students to customize UI, create their own virtual objects (different colors/shapes), and submit their .zip or git branch.
Add challenge tasks: enable gesture-based object movement, label objects, or persist positions robustly.

6. Assessment Rubric
UI/UX clarity (20%)
Object management and workflow (30%)
Code style and documentation (20%)
Real-device AR (optional, 30%)
